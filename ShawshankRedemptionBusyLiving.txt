think you'll ever get out of here me
yeah one day when I got a long white
beard
two or three marbles rolling around
upstairs let me out Junior where I go -
ha - nail so what you ought to new to
Mexico little place on the Pacific Ocean
you own the Mexican say about the
Pacific see it has no memory I swear I
want to live the rest of my life
warm place no memory

beach
I so worthless old boat fix it up new
take my guests out chart fishing say
what nail
yeah place like that I could use a man
that knows how to get things
I don't think I could make it on the
outside Andy
I bet in here most of my life I'm an
institutional man now it's like Brooks
pons

I don't think so
in here I'm the guy who can get things

the yellow pages hell I wouldn't even
know where to begin
Pacific Ocean yeah I scared me to death

and you're in here and that's the way it
is

I'm in here I guess it comes down to a
simple choice really get busy living or
get busy dying
