00:01
again I'm Adam welcome back to ink
00:04
vidcom today I have a very important
00:07
lesson I think for all of you that will
00:09
help you very much with your reading but
00:12
especially your writing skills okay
00:14
today we're going to look at the
00:16
sentence what is a sentence now I know
00:19
that obvious on you well we know what a
00:21
sentence is we've learned this a
00:23
thousand times before right I know what
00:25
you've learned and I know what you
00:26
haven't learned many of you some of you
00:28
have of course the sentence has a very
00:31
basic structure there's a very basic
00:32
component that must be involved and
00:35
included in a sentence and a lot of
00:38
grammar teachers a lot of English
00:39
teachers don't teach this okay all of
00:42
you I'm sure have by now heard of SVO
00:45
but have you heard of SVHC have you
00:48
heard of SVC maybe yes maybe no but I'm
00:51
sure a lot of you are going what never
00:54
heard of these things before well we're
00:55
going to talk about this in one second
00:57
before we talk about a sentence we have
00:59
to talk about a clause now what is a
01:02
clause I'm sure you've heard this word
01:03
before as well but just in case a clause
01:06
is any subject verb combination it's a
01:10
group of words that must include a
01:12
subject and a verb now also very
01:16
important to remember it must be a tense
01:18
verb meaning that it must take a time
01:21
past present future okay no base verb no
01:26
infinitive verb so that is a clause now
01:29
there are two types of clauses okay we
01:32
have independent clauses and we have
01:34
dependent clauses the these are
01:37
sometimes called subordinate clauses now
01:39
every sentence in English to be a
01:43
grammatically correct sentence must have
01:46
an independent clause
01:48
it doesn't need a dependent clause but
01:50
it could have one the independent clause
01:53
could include a dependent clause as the
01:57
subject or object we'll talk about that
01:59
after so an independent clause has a
02:02
subject and a verb and it can stand by
02:05
itself it can contain a complete idea by
02:10
itself okay so
02:12
that's technically the shortest sentence
02:15
you can have in English will be a end
02:19
will be an independent clause with a
02:21
subject and verb what is the absolute
02:23
shortest sentence that you can think of
02:26
think of a sentence the shortest you can
02:28
possibly make it okay here's an example
02:33
go
02:35
is this a complete English sentence yes
02:38
why because it contains an independent
02:42
clause where we have the implied subject
02:47
you and the tense verb go the imperative
02:50
tense go so this is your your basic
02:54
English sentence now we have three other
02:57
types three basic types then we can of
03:00
course play with these after
03:02
subject-verb-object some independent
03:06
clauses must have an object we'll talk
03:09
about that in a second excuse me subject
03:12
verb subject complement some sentences
03:16
must have a subject complement subject
03:19
verb complement okay we're going to talk
03:22
about each of these in a moment I have
03:24
the a here because quite often this
03:26
complement is actually an adverb phrase
03:28
or an adverbial we'll talk about that in
03:31
a second so your basic sentence can be
03:34
any one of these three now the reason
03:36
we're looking at this all these
03:38
structures is because once you
03:40
understand what must be contained in a
03:43
sentence then you can read any English
03:45
sentence out there that is grammatically
03:47
correct and be able to understand the
03:50
main idea of that sentence okay so let's
03:53
start with SVO okay let's look at our
03:56
SVO
03:57
type of independent clause subject verb
04:00
object now first what is an object well
04:04
we have two types of objects to talk
04:07
about we have the direct object we have
04:09
the indirect object now the thing to
04:12
understand is that the object always
04:14
answers a question about the verb it
04:17
completes the meaning of the verb by
04:20
asking the questions what or who
04:26
now keep in mind that technically it's
04:29
whom but if you say who let it go this
04:32
time okay
04:33
formal academic writing whom whom hmm
04:36
IELTS TOEFL SAT all that whom not who in
04:40
the object position but the direct
04:44
object answers who what or who about the
04:46
verb okay we'll get back to that an
04:49
indirect object answers the question to
04:53
what or for what or whom to what for
05:03
what to whom for whom usually about the
05:07
object about the direct object you will
05:09
never see an indirect object without a
05:11
direct object in the sentence as well
05:14
now again before I get back to the
05:16
object let me explain this word
05:18
transitive verb I don't care if you
05:21
remember this word or not it's not
05:22
important that's just a grammar word
05:24
understand the meaning of this situation
05:26
a transitive verb must take an object a
05:34
direct object okay look at this sentence
05:39
here I want is this a complete sentence
05:42
I have a subject and a verb right should
05:44
be okay want is a transitive verb
05:47
there's no such thing as wanting without
05:49
wanting something okay so this is not a
05:53
complete sentence this sentence or this
05:55
clause must take an object I want candy
06:02
now it's complete because it answers the
06:05
question what about want not all verbs
06:09
are transitive
06:09
some are intransitive means they don't
06:11
take an object some are called ambi
06:14
transitive means in some situations they
06:16
take an object in some situations they
06:18
don't take an object but that's for a
06:20
different lesson altogether so we have
06:22
SVO must have an object to the verb now
06:25
here she gave Mary a letter we have our
06:29
subject she we have our verb gave past
06:32
tense
06:33
Mary okay she gave who know she gave
06:37
what a letter we have our direct object
06:41
to Mary indirect object
06:46
she gave a letter to Mary she gave Mary
06:49
a letter
06:49
okay so we have she gave what again this
06:53
is a transitive verb it must take an
06:55
object a direct object she gave a letter
06:57
to Mary our indirect object this is a
07:00
complete independent clause a complete
07:03
idea full of meaning ready to be added
07:06
onto now what you put before what you
07:08
put after that's all compliments
07:11
basically it's not important you can
07:13
have a lot more phrases you can have
07:15
other clauses you can have subordinate
07:18
clauses added to this this is your main
07:21
idea of the sentence that's your
07:23
independent clause let's look at the
07:25
other type the subject verb subject
07:27
complements okay so now we're going to
07:30
look at the other type of sentence to
07:32
tell other type of independent clauses
07:33
you can have subject verb subject
07:36
complement before we look at it I want
07:38
you to notice very carefully this e here
07:42
okay we don't have complement complement
07:50
complement this one means to complete
07:53
something this one means to say nice
07:56
things about someone oh I like your
07:57
shirt it's very nice it suits you that's
07:59
a compliment compliment to complete so a
08:03
subject complement completes the meaning
08:05
of something now we have the object
08:09
before the object answered the question
08:11
about the verb right it completed the
08:13
meaning of the verb the subject
08:15
complement completes some of the meaning
08:18
or says something about the subject not
08:21
the verb okay
08:22
it also answers the question what about
08:27
the subject one way to think about this
08:30
is think of the verb that be verb and
08:33
it's always going to be a be verb think
08:36
of it as an equal sign subject equals
08:39
the subject complement so for example
08:42
and many students still ask me this so
08:44
I'll say it again I am
08:46
Canadian so I equals Canadian Canadian
08:50
completes the meaning of I same thing
08:53
right this is the completion of me this
08:55
sentence looks a little bit more
08:57
complicated but it's the exact same
08:59
thing the weatherman must be wrong about
09:02
today's forecast I still have the be
09:05
verb this modal must only tells me
09:08
something about the the degree of the be
09:11
verb it doesn't tell me anything about
09:12
the subject or the complement
09:14
so the weatherman wrong the weatherman
09:19
is wrong about today's forecast this is
09:23
just an extra piece of information it is
09:26
a complement to wrong wrong about what
09:33
that we're going to talk about different
09:35
types of complements like this one wrong
09:38
is a complement to weatherman about
09:40
today's forecast is a complement to
09:42
wrong a sentence can have many
09:44
complements okay and the dependent
09:47
clause can only have one object one
09:48
subject one verb however you can have
09:51
many clauses in a sentence you can only
09:53
have one independent clause unless of
09:56
course you have two independent clause
09:59
joined by a conjunction and but or etc
10:03
we'll talk about that in a little bit as
10:05
well
10:05
so the matoran weatherman must be wrong
10:08
about today's forecast so this is your
10:10
subject verb subject verb subject
10:14
complement now we're going to look at
10:15
the last one subject verb complement
10:18
okay let's look at there our last one we
10:21
have SV a I put a because quite often
10:25
when you have to have it it's an
10:26
adverbial but technically anything
10:29
that's not an object or a subject
10:30
complement is just a complement it is
10:32
necessary to for the completion of the
10:35
sentence now an adverbial why do we call
10:38
it an adverbial because it answers the
10:40
questions where when how why we saw that
10:45
the object answers what or who adverbial
10:48
answers the other questions about what
10:49
about the subject no it's about the verb
10:54
again okay
10:55
so for example if I say I went is this a
10:59
complete
10:59
sentence no because go means you had to
11:02
go somewhere
11:03
technically in certain context it could
11:06
be an answer to another question but as
11:08
by itself it's not a complete sentence I
11:10
need to add something to it
11:12
I went to the store I went where to the
11:19
store so to the story is a compliment
11:21
but it's acting as an adverb because it
11:23
answers one of these questions remember
11:25
it compliment and I just want to explain
11:28
it here completes the meaning of
11:39
something it could come in this case it
11:42
completes the meaning of the verb but
11:44
compliments can also complete the
11:46
meanings of something else we add s vs C
11:48
completes the meaning of the subject we
11:50
can also have complements that complete
11:52
the meaning of an object or preposition
11:54
or many other things I'll give you a few
11:57
examples soon bill lives in Hawaii bill
12:00
lives where in Hawaii
12:02
now I want you to also look at this
12:04
sentence Carl reads now could this end
12:07
this clause I should say subject verb
12:09
could this be a complete sentence sure
12:11
what does Carl do what does Carl do in
12:14
his spare time he reads now what he
12:18
reads maybe not important I want the
12:20
action more than the thing he reads
12:22
however I see Carl he's reading all the
12:28
time and I think why is he in school no
12:29
Carl reads for pleasure
12:33
I need this piece of information to
12:39
complete the idea to complete the
12:42
meaning of this sentence Carl reads
12:45
books and Carl reads for pleasure are
12:48
two completely different sentences they
12:51
have completely different meanings if I
12:53
want to specify a particular meaning I
12:55
want to tell you why he reads then I
12:58
have to add this compliment I have to
13:00
add this adverbial to complete the
13:03
meaning of this verb he reads newspapers
13:06
he reads comic books he reads obituaries
13:10
you know what bitch Oh areas in
13:12
newspapers sometimes they put little
13:14
notices of people who died some people
13:16
like to read these things I don't know
13:18
why but some people do but Carl
13:20
he reads for pleasure he enjoys it it's
13:23
fun for him but this completes the
13:25
meaning of that so there you have the
13:28
three types now the thing to remember is
13:31
that you can mix all of these you can
13:33
have sv a oh well no you can't have SB a
13:37
you can have sv o a you can have sv o si
13:41
you can have sv a AC etc you can mix
13:45
them I'm going to give you a couple of
13:46
examples here to see what I'm talking
13:49
about okay let's look at some examples
13:51
here
13:51
I want keep in mind this is very basic
13:54
stuff you're going to see very very
13:56
complicated sentences in your readings
13:58
especially once you get into academic
14:00
readings but I went to the store to buy
14:03
bread for breakfast this morning
14:05
now this might seem like a bit of a
14:07
complicated sentence but it's actually a
14:09
simple sentence and it only has SV lots
14:14
of C's okay I went subject-verb where to
14:22
the store this is an adverbial where to
14:25
buy bread why why did I go to the store
14:29
for breakfast bread for what at the
14:36
store I bought bread I bought bread for
14:39
breakfast
14:40
when this morning this is goes back to
14:43
went okay all of these are compliments
14:47
to the to each other and to the verb
14:49
went you can have many compliments you
14:52
don't want to have to too many because
14:54
then your sentence becomes long and a
14:56
little bit boring a little bit in danger
14:58
of being run on okay but you can add as
15:02
many as you want
15:02
now the compliments could be anything
15:04
could be infinitive phrase or participle
15:07
phrase or clause or gerund or noun
15:10
phrase anything okay as long as it's
15:13
grammatically correct here's another
15:15
sentence now this one also looks a
15:17
little complicated it's not either what
15:19
Sharon forgot to mention was that her
15:21
husband was the CEO of Microsoft and
15:24
makes a lot of money
15:25
which is why she can afford all of her
15:27
holidays sorry I forgot to call mother
15:30
okay now you're thinking oh wow I have
15:33
no idea first thing what I said you have
15:36
to find your independent clause first
15:38
now keep in mind a subject can be a
15:41
subordinate clause as well what is the
15:43
subject of this entire sentence is it
15:46
Sharon no is it CEO is that her husband
15:50
is it Microsoft no what we have here is
15:54
a noun clause subject this is your
16:01
subject a subject which is an
16:03
independent dependent clause sorry this
16:06
is called a noun clause it has its own
16:08
subject and verb remember a dependent
16:10
clause also has a subject and verb
16:12
forgot what to mention it has an object
16:15
to forgot now here is your verb what
16:18
okay
16:20
her husband that her husband was the CEO
16:23
of Microsoft and makes a lot of money
16:30
share differ this is a subject this is
16:33
the subject complement because we have a
16:35
be verb this is also a noun clause with
16:38
its own subject and verb that her
16:41
husband was the CEO and that he makes a
16:44
lot of money okay which is why she can
16:48
afford all of her holidays we were
16:49
wondering Sharon goes away on holiday
16:51
all the time but she doesn't work how
16:53
does she do that she's never told us
16:55
that she inherited money oh what she
16:57
forgot to mention last time she
16:59
explained was that blah blah blah okay
17:01
so this is a compliment now of course
17:06
this doesn't look too easy remember a
17:08
subject could be anything an object can
17:10
be anything look not anything but it's
17:11
all kinds of subjects and objects we'll
17:13
discuss that another time find your
17:16
subject your main subject find your main
17:18
verb find your object compliment etc now
17:24
remember I said every sentence must have
17:26
at least one independent clause it could
17:28
have two it could have three as long as
17:30
you have a coordinating conjunction and
17:33
but or John loves Kate John loves who
17:37
Kate and
17:38
kate loves john subject-verb-object
17:40
subject-verb-object
17:42
two independent clauses one sentence
17:46
conjunction okay this might seem a
17:49
little bit difficult but there's a quiz
17:51
on ink vidcom go to it check it out and
17:54
