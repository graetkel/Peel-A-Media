Chicken parm, one of the most exciting chicken
00:02
dishes anywhere on the planet.
00:03
And the secret behind this one is the flour, egg wash,
00:05
bread crumb, and then that crispy texture
00:07
to perfect a stunning dish.
00:11
First thing, trim the chicken breasts.
00:13
This is a supreme of chicken.
00:15
We've taken out the filet.
00:16
Basically, that's the tender.
00:18
You don't need that on there.
00:19
Lay it down.
00:20
Take a knife, put your hand on, and just literally slice into
00:24
the middle all the way over.
00:25
Run the point just to the tip, and then open it up.
00:28
That chicken breast is double the size so it's half as thin.
00:31
To get it nice and even, parchment paper, one piece.
00:34
Chicken on top, parchment paper on top, and then all we do
00:38
is literally roll.
00:40
Look what's happening to my chicken.
00:42
It spreading out.
00:43
And what we're doing now is turning
00:45
this into a beautiful escallop.
00:48
That is now ready for your flour,
00:50
egg wash, and breadcrumb.
00:51
Lay that into the flour.
00:52
Make sure you lightly dust the chicken with flour
00:56
and just shake off the excess flour.
00:59
Next, into a most amazing egg wash.
01:01
Submerge that down, let it disappear under the egg.
01:04
It's going to hold all those incredible breadcrumbs
01:06
together.
01:07
For me, bread crumbs are boring.
01:09
We zest that up with a touch of salt, a touch of pepper,
01:11
of smoked paprika--
01:13
just a touch-- and then Parmesan cheese.
01:15
The Parmesan cheese gives it this really
01:17
nice sort of caramelized cheese effect on top of the chicken.
01:21
Mix that up.
01:23
Watch that Parmesan almost disappear through.
01:24
Take your chicken out, give it a little shake, and then straight
01:28
into your bread crumbs.
01:29
Roll it around.
01:30
Get a handful of bread crumbs, sprinkle over the chicken.
01:32
And the secret here is to make sure
01:34
that you cover all the little pieces of exposed chicken.
01:37
Here's where we take the chicken parm to another level.
01:40
Take your parchment paper, flip it over.
01:42
Take out, shake any excess off, lay that on top of the paper.
01:46
Turn the paper the other way around.
01:48
Lay that on top.
01:50
Go back to your rolling pin and then just gently roll.
01:52
Now, what's happening now is all those breadcrumbs are sticking
01:56
right into the chicken.
01:57
The secret behind that is to get that done literally 10 minutes
01:59
before you cook it and those breadcrumbs stay on there.
02:02
Water boiling for the spaghetti.
02:04
A tough of olive oil, salt in.
02:07
Spaghetti into the water.
02:09
Let's the spaghetti cook for 10 seconds and then from there,
02:11
twist it around as it just starts to bend
02:14
and then literally twist that into the pan.
02:16
That is going to take nine to 10 minutes of boiling.
02:19
Lid back on.
02:20
Now we can start cooking our chicken.
02:22
Once the chicken is that thin, it
02:23
doesn't need to be deep fried.
02:24
Sometimes, chicken parm gets cooked in too deep oil.
02:27
So rapeseed oil, literally a tablespoon.
02:29
Get that oil nice and hot.
02:30
Lift up the chicken parm and you lay that into your pan.
02:34
That's the northern way way.
02:36
Two and a half minutes each side.
02:37
The secret now is by the time my chicken is
02:39
cooked my spaghetti is ready.
02:41
They take literally nine to 10 minutes from start to finish.
02:44
Once you've get the color on top,
02:45
start placing little bits of butter underneath.
02:48
That makes the bread crumbs golden brown.
02:51
Flip over.
02:52
Two and a half minutes each side.
02:53
Turn it once and once only.
02:55
From there, take it out onto a platter nice and carefully.
02:59
Look at that.
02:59
Wow.
03:01
We top this with its marina sauce.
03:02
It's a spoon of this incredible rich tomato sauce
03:05
right smack bang in the middle.
03:07
Then we sit our mozzarella on top of that, season mozzarella
03:11
with salt and pepper.
03:12
Into the oven we go.
03:14
The perfect garnish for this is the most amazing broccoli rabe.
03:17
These are young broccoli stems.
03:19
They Need sauteing very quickly and finishing
03:21
with a touch of chili flake and then just a touch
03:24
of lemon juice for acidity.
03:25
A teaspoon of olive oil in.
03:26
Broccoli, lay it in the pan.
03:28
I want a bit of color on here, really important.
03:30
Beautiful.
03:31
So and pepper.
03:32
We're just starting to get some color on the broccoli rabe.
03:34
You should season it with some chili flakes.
03:36
Amazing.
03:37
I'm going to drain off my pasta.
03:40
As that sits there, lightly season
03:42
it with olive oil, salt and pepper,
03:44
and a touch of fresh parsley.
03:46
A teaspoon of sauce in the pasta.
03:47
Don't drown it.
03:49
Get some basil leaves and just literally
03:50
break up the basil leaves.
03:52
Now twist it around.
03:53
The tomato sauce has sort of stained the pasta.
03:56
It's got really nice, fragrant smell of fresh basil
03:59
in there-- beautiful, ready to go.
04:02
Chicken parm, look at that-- beautiful.
04:05
Now for the exciting part, plating.
04:06
This broccoli rabe is so healthy.
04:08
That sits in the center of the plate.
04:10
Underneath add a nice spoon of sauce on there.
04:14
And then look, the chicken parm goes on the broccoli.
04:17
And then you just sort of knit the pasta together.
04:19
Use the bowl here and you just life
04:23
and turn so you've got that really
04:25
nice exciting barrel of pasta.
04:27
That sits there.
04:28
And finally, a little touch of sauce.
04:31
Finish that with some freshly grated aged Parmesan.
04:34
That has to be one of the most delicious chicken
04:36
parms anywhere.
