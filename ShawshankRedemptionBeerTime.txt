03:15
what do you do me staring at back to
03:17
work work
03:28
and that's how it came to pass but on
03:31
the second-to-last day of the job the
03:34
convict crew that tarred the plate
03:36
factory roof from the spring of 49 wound
03:39
up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in
03:41
the morning drinking icy cold Bohemia
03:44
styled beer crazy of the hardest screw
03:48
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank
03:49
State Prison pick up while it's cold
03:52
ladies the colossal prick even managed
03:57
to sound magnanimous
04:00
we sat and drank with the Sun on our
04:02
shoulders and felt like freemen hell we
04:06
could have been tearing the roof of one
04:07
of our own houses we were the Lords of
04:10
all creation as for Andy he spent that
04:15
break haunted in the shade a strange
04:17
little smile on his face watching this
04:20
drink his beer
04:28
Hey
04:30
want a cold one Andy no thanks
04:33
gave up drinking
04:38
you could argue he'd done it to curry
04:41
favor with the guards or maybe make a
04:44
few friends among us cons me I think he
04:49
did it just to feel normal again
04:51
if only for a short while
