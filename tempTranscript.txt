Hello darlings, and welcome to episode 11 of cooking with Marshmello
We've got one of your favorite Asian dishes on the menu today, Mello
Mongolian beef. Let's show them what's in store...
We'll need garlic cloves thinly sliced, sliced beef
3/4 of a cup of water, soy sauce
Cornstarch, sugar
Chili pepper flakes
Vegetable oil, carrots and green onions cut into 2-inch pieces
To begin, add the soy sauce and garlic over the beef tonight
Now heat the pan and drizzle in some vegetable oil
Once it's nice and hot, sear the beef in the pan
Once the beef is cooked, please remove it and set aside on a separate plate
Add a little more oil to the pan and saut√© the carrots and the green onions into a vessel
Now add sugar, cornstarch, water, chili pepper flakes and soy sauce into the mix and stir
Next add the beef and green parts of the green onions and a low liquid to come to a boil
When the sauce is stick and shiny remove from the heat and place into a bowl
There you have it, I must say one of the most delicious dishes yet, Marshmello.
See you all next week!
